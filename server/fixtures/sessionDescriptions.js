    'description' : "Medical procedures are complex and require training. Additional tools,  such as live ultrasound imaging during central line placement and new  procedures, such as intraosseous line placement, have become widely  available over the last decade. While these modalities are a great help  to increase success, reduce time requirements and avoid complications  for experienced providers, learning the use of these tools and  techniques can be daunting, stressful and time-consuming for the  beginner and might even initially increase risk or discomfort for the  patient. Medical simulation of procedures is a way out of this dilemma.  The task trainers that are now available allow the training of these  procedures in a controlled environment with less time pressure and  totally abate any risk or discomfort for the patient for the initial  training steps. We have therefore introduced simulation task training in  the course “Advanced Anesthesia for Complex Cases – Planning and  Procedures”. After a 30 minutes introduction into anesthesia for complex  cases and indications for specific advanced procedures, the medical  student in the Anesthesia 110 and 140 courses have 90 minutes to  practice intraosseous line placement, ultrasound guided placement of  central lines in the Seldinger technique and ultrasound guided line  placement using task trainers. Other anesthesia providers from the VA  anesthesia department assist with this course."
